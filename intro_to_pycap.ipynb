      "# General REDCap API Usage\n",
      "\n",
      "[Scott Burns](http://sburns.org), last updated 2013-07-12\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as I can tell, there isn't a tutorial on the internet about how to use the REDCap API. So here goes...\n",
      "\n",
      "[REDCap](http://project-redcap.org) is an advanced web-based application for securely storing and retrieving tabular data. In simple terms, it can be thought of a web-based spreadsheet, though it is much more than that. It provides an **Application Programming Interface** which means external software can programmatically download and upload data into REDCap Projects. This tutorial assumes working knowledge of REDCap. When all else fails, please consult your site's API help page, which is at https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/api/help for Vanderbilt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Becuase the API is based on simple HTTP requests, any programming langauge with a HTTP library can use the REDCap API. I'm going to demonstrate simple API usage in python using the wonderful [requests](http://python-requests.org) library.\n",
      "\n",
      "To use the REDCap API, you must know the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   The API URL for your site's REDCap installation. For Vanderbilt, this url is `https://redcap.vanderbilt.edu/api/`.\n",
      "*   The API token for your Project. A token is generated by the REDCap administrators and connects your user account to a particular REDCap Project. Therefore, if you have API access to many Projects, you will have many tokens to manage.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Basic Usage\n",
      "\n",
      "Every call to the REDCap API is a HTTP POST request with specific parameters in the payload. The `token` parameter is always required as this tells the API from which Project you're requesting a response. Next, the `content` parameter is used to declare the type of request you're making. Finally, you may want to include the `format` field as well as this tells the API in what format you want the response. It defaults to returning a CSV string, but I generally prefer getting [json-formatted](http://www.json.org) responses as that format can be easily converted to actual in-memory objects like lists, dictionaries, strings, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "So let's begin by making the most simple request, exporting the Project's Metadata (AKA Data Dictionary)."

      "-   Under no circumstance should you ever publicize your Project token. This is like publishing the password you use to login to REDCap, which you would never do. In this instance however, this token is from a dummy project I use to test things with. There's no real data and definitely not any PHI in it, so I'm not super worried.\n",

Python is also very popular in web development communities so there are web frameworks like [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com) and [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org) in case you want to build websites or applications.
